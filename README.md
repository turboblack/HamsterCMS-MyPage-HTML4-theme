HamsterCMS MyPage HTML4 theme

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS

This template is special without graphics to speed up work on weak PCs and slow connections, the template weighs 11kb

the template is partially backward compatible with all browsers since the late 90s

interesting javascript effect for content

Works equally well (does not crumble) with Internet Explorer 5 and modern browsers

The code is simple and clear
The template is perfect for learning HTML and maintaining a home page

To use a template, create an **with any name** folder in the **templates** folder, copy files there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

This is what this template looks like
